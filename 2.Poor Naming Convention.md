## Poor Naming Convention
### Inconsistent Naming Convention
developers coming from other backgrounds tend to adopt a different naming convention. 

```
Customer GetCustomer(int _id);
Customer saveCustomer(Customer Customer);
private int customerId;
```

first method: first letter of every word is capitalized.  
second method: first letter of first word is lowercase.  
parameters: first one uses an underline. The second one doesn't. 
third example: private field but no underlying 

### standard naming convention 
Nomi di classi e interfacce devono essere in PascalCase.  
Nomi di metodi devono essere in camelCase  
Nomi di variabili devono essere in camelCase  
Nomi di parametri devono essere in camelCase  
Nomi di costanti devono essere in UPPER_CASE  

make sure to follow this convention and ask everyone in your team to follow same convention.  
code will be cleaner and it looks like it's written by one person
